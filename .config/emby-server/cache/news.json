[{"Title":"Emby Server 4.7 Release: Many New Features, Improvements and Fixes","Link":"https://emby.media/community/index.php?/blogs/entry/527-emby-server-47-release-many-new-features-improvements-and-fixes/","Description":"Emby Server 4.7 is Released with Many New Features, Improvements and Fixes\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEmby Server 4.7 is starting to rollout to different platforms. It's packed with new features, improvements and fixes. We wanted to give you a Preview of some new functionality and changes to Live TV as well as bring to your attention possible post installation configuration changes that might be required.\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\tIf you currently use one of the following Live TV Plugins (NextPVR, MediaPortal, ServerWMC, TVHeadEnd, TVMosaic, Vu+, DVBLink or DVBViewer) you will need to reconfigure the plugin after it is updated following the 4.7 installation (the server checks for new plugins after a new install). As part of this process the guide will refresh.  Please let it completely finish before going to the next step.  Once the guide refresh is complete please go to Live TV menu and add a new tuner. You will see an entry for the plugin you are using. See Below:\n\n\n\n\t \n\n\n\n\tLive TV has many new features as well as a new plugin framework. Our own internal tuners and guide have been moved into plugins using this new framework as well. Setting up a tuner for use in Emby thanks to the new framework allows for a unified architecture, simplifying tuner/source setup. Here's an example of the Add TV Source dialog showing a few of the different choices using the new plugins.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWhenever you install a new Live TV Plugin an entry will appear on this dialog. All available tuner types are now managed from one central place simplifying setup and configuration. All tuner types now share a common set of features. This allows 3rd party plugins to work exactly the same as Emby provided sources. This is now possible thanks to a new TV framework Emby uses debuting in this release.  This new framework allows for simpler TV plugin creation as the server takes over responsibility of many functions previously needed at the plugin level.  This helps to prevent issues related to specific plugin code as Emby server can now handle streams in a very consistent manner regardless of source. This is a WIN/WIN for developers as well as users!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tEmby Server 4.7 along with it's new TV plugin Framework includes new features and expanded functionality. Some of the highlights are:\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tSupport for OTA ATSC 3.0 &amp; 4K Live TV\n\t\tIf you have an ATSC 3.0 compatible tuner and live in a TV market currently broadcasting ATSC 3.0, Emby has everything you need to embrace this new technology. This includes new support for the proprietary AC-4 coded needed to decode audio streams.  Not only will you get a beautiful picture especially on 4K HDR channels, but awesome sound as well!\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tCable Support for 4K Channels\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tEmby supports receiving 4K digital cable channels. All you need is a compatible tuner like the ever popular HDHomeRun Prime. Of course your provider needs to support 4K channel transmission and have this turned on for you account. Check your providers website for 4K support as many providers have this available, often at no additional cost.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t4K Channel support is not limited to built in OTA and Cable tuners but is fully supported through all tuner types if the source itself support 4K.\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tHere's a great screenshot of a 4K SDR broadcast captured from an HDHomeRun Prime tuner:\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tUniversal Closed Caption Support In All Emby Clients\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEvery Emby Client including web browsers fully support Closed Captions, not to be confused with subtitles. The Emby Transcoder is fully Closed Caption aware, so it doesn't matter how or where you play Live TV in Emby, it's now available if you require it.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tManual Recordings Support\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAnother new addition to Emby is support for manual recordings regardless if you have guide information or not.  You can setup these recordings to use specific channels, set the starting start and end times, you can set the frequency of recordings (one and done or Recurring)  as well as specific days of the week. Of course you can personalize the title of the recording(s) as well.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYou can setup a manual recording easily by clicking the the Create Recording button followed by choosing the Channel and Time option on the popup window.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tYou can then setup the manual recording criteria that will be used.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHere you see the custom recording already scheduled to record.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMultiple Channel Support for Series Recordings\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can now setup a single recording that can be used across specific multiple channels you choose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmby also has adds new options to allow:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSupport Negative Recording Padding Values\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEnter a negative Number in the Start or End Options\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMax Recording Length for Series Recordings \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can now set as a precaution a maximum duration that any recording can have.

You can see the transcoder is Throttling (waiting) as it's producing 53fps which is more than what's needed at the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe new Now playing also sports new features such as being able to click on the video name (ie Apollo 13) and be taking directly to it's detail page.

Change volume, set repeat mode, pause, stop, change tracks or switch views as shown above. The toolbar stays at the bottom of the screen for music while allowing you to explore other parts of the system.  Very Nice!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAudio Book Continue Listening\n\t\t\t\t\tEmby supports continue listening to Audio Books.  The above screen shot shows the docked toolbar at the bottom of the screen while the top portion show a new option being set to display on the home screen to be able to quickly access and continue listening to audio files.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNew On Screen Display (OSD) Features\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSome of the new 4.7 OSD features have been shown recently in a couple Emby client blog posts using a preview release of 4.7. Some of the functionality of visual timelines and thumbnail graphics have been available in some form the past but now are fully unified in a cohesive manner that's very easy to use from a keyboard, mouse or remote.  It's very slick, adds new navigational functionality as well as additional information you had to quick playing in the past to access. You can see how much thought and care went into this design allowing it to work effortlessly across the different cleints.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVisual Timeline Showing Overlayed Chapter Information Done Through Keyboard Navigation\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInfo - Bottom-Left Menu Option\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis will bring up information about the movies, show episode or TV channel you happen to be watching.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChapters Menu\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis shows the next menu option displaying a list of embedded chapters including the Chapter name, the timeline it starts as well as of thumbnail from the start of the scene.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCast &amp; Crews\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow often have you watched something and wanted to know the actor or actresses name playing a part? Previously you had to exit playback to look this information up but now it's right here always available a click or two away. What a non-intrusive time saver this option is!\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Now\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can quickly and easily see what's on TV using the two new views added to the OSD. The On Now view above uses the programs graphics if available (Emby Guide supports this) to show what's currently on each channel in your lineup.  You can easily scroll the list sideways to get a good look at everything currently being broadcast. The Guide showed below allows you to quickly see what's on a currently as well as what's coming on later.  It's not limited to what's shown but allows scrolling up and down channels as well as the timeline so you can see what's coming on 12 hours from now.  It's a fully functional Mini-Guide built right into the OSD.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll of the OSD functions shown above work right over top the currently playing media allowing you access to a lot of new information with the least amount of disruption possible. Previously you probably got gripes and complaints from family members if you exited the media playback to get a look at the cast list to see the name of the actor. Now instead of having to wait to the end of the movie to see the cast list or catching wrath from the family, you can quickly view this information in a non-disruptive manner.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHaving all this new information as well as new tools for easier navigation right at your fingertips during playback shows how much thought and design went into this new version. Emby sets the bar high for OSD functionality that others can't compare to.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore To Come!\n\t\t\t\t\tWe're excited to share how awesome Emby Server 4.7 release is. We plan to following up this blog post with additional posts in the coming days expanding on it's new features. A special thank you goes out to all the people that helped test the many beta versions along the way!  Inevitably with a monster release of this size there will likely be some issues we'll address with quick to follow maintenance releases. Please make sure to let us know in the community forum what you think of our new 4.7 release and any issues or questions you might have. Post Questions, Comments and Issues

Here's an example of the Add TV Source dialog showing a few of the different choices using the new plugins.\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<img alt=\"image.png.c0abc9fe750321871528be388fc454a1.png\" class=\"ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\" data-fileid=\"130143\" data-ratio=\"138.01\" width=\"542\" src=\"https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2022_05/image.png.c0abc9fe750321871528be388fc454a1.png\">\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\tWhenever you install a new Live TV Plugin an entry will appear on this dialog. All available tuner types are now managed from one central place simplifying setup and configuration. All tuner types now share a common set of features. This allows 3rd party plugins to work exactly the same as Emby provided sources. This is now possible thanks to a new TV framework Emby uses debuting in this release.  This new framework allows for simpler TV plugin creation as the server takes over responsibility of many functions previously needed at the plugin level.  This helps to prevent issues related to specific plugin code as Emby server can now handle streams in a very consistent manner regardless of source. This is a WIN/WIN for developers as well as users!\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t \n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\tEmby Server 4.7 along with it's new TV plugin Framework includes new features and expanded functionality.

This includes new support for the proprietary AC-4 coded needed to decode audio streams.  Not only will you get a beautiful picture especially on 4K HDR channels, but awesome sound as well!\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t<b>Cable Support for 4K Channels</b>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\tEmby supports receiving 4K digital cable channels. All you need is a compatible tuner like the ever popular HDHomeRun Prime. Of course your provider needs to support 4K channel transmission and have this turned on for you account. Check your providers website for 4K support as many providers have this available, often at no additional cost.\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<br>\n\t\t4K Channel support is not limited to built in OTA and Cable tuners but is fully supported through all tuner types if the source itself support 4K.<br>\n\t\t \n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\tHere's a great screenshot of a 4K SDR broadcast captured from an HDHomeRun Prime tuner:<a class=\"ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image\" data-fileext=\"png\" data-fileid=\"130144\" href=\"https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2022_05/image.png.b9c0e7ea63243c6901df5af188faebd7.png\" rel=\"\"><img alt=\"image.thumb.png.8cf3b5d5cb11763f155748a32ae6f842.png\" class=\"ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\" data-fileid=\"130144\" data-ratio=\"56.17\" width=\"1200\" src=\"https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2022_05/image.thumb.png.8cf3b5d5cb11763f155748a32ae6f842.png\"></a>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t \n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<b>Universal Closed Caption Support In All Emby Clients</b>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tEvery Emby Client including web browsers fully support Closed Captions, not to be confused with subtitles.

The Guide showed below allows you to quickly see what's on a currently as well as what's coming on later.  It's not limited to what's shown but allows scrolling up and down channels as well as the timeline so you can see what's coming on 12 hours from now.  It's a fully functional Mini-Guide built right into the OSD.\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image\" data-fileext=\"png\" data-fileid=\"130223\" href=\"https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2022_05/image.png.28403d2ff3907610591bc69002e06346.png\" rel=\"\"><img alt=\"image.thumb.png.cab90de32411a89b2878f7b740b42616.png\" class=\"ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\" data-fileid=\"130223\" data-ratio=\"56.00\" width=\"1200\" src=\"https://emby.media/community/uploads/monthly_2022_05/image.thumb.png.cab90de32411a89b2878f7b740b42616.png\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\tAll of the OSD functions shown above work right over top the currently playing media allowing you access to a lot of new information with the least amount of disruption possible.

We hope you enjoy the many new features of this build!\n\n\n\n\tVisual Timeline Seeking including Thumbnail Graphics\n\tIncluded in our new 1.2.6 release for Samsung is support for visual seeking. You can Rewind, Fast Forward or Jump to any position in the timeline\n\tquickly and easily using our new seeking. Best of all, our new seeking combined with thumbnail graphics makes it easy to pin-point the scene you want to re-watch or queue up.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe above pictures shows how easy it is to find a scene you want to watch.

Here are the highlights.\n\n\n\n\tRewritten Music Scanning\n\n\n\n\tThis 4.6 release will rescan your music library. We apologize if this causes any inconvenience. This solves a lot of our previous music-related shortcomings, specifically:\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAny folder structure now accepted, no matter how clean or dirty\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAlbums are now fully tag driven and are no longer tied to folders\n\t\n\t\n\t\tLocal metadata for albums will still be supported, and local metadata for artists will be back as well. This will be the only feature of a music library that will require a predictable folder structure. If you enable these options you'll need to have an artist\\album\\track folder structure, otherwise you'll likely end up seeing nfo files and images in unexpected places. You'll need to use your music library options to indicate your music folder structure if you'd like to use local artwork.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPreserve original order of tagged genres, artists, album artists, tags, etc.\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSupport multiple musicbrainz id's tagged on songs and albums\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSupport for composers \n\t\n\t\n\t\tLibrary metadata options for artists now working again (and still working for albums)\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Folders tab is now an actual folder view and will work properly as such\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMusic Composer Support\n\n\n\n\tThis was mentioned above, but if your audio files are tagged with composer values, then you'll now see a new Composers tab in your music library:\n\t\n\n\n\n\tImproved Database and User Interface Performance\n\n\n\n\tAll Emby apps should feel snappier than ever thanks to a plethora of new improvements in your Emby server database.\n\n\n\n\tReworked Collection Storage Model\n\n\n\n\tCollections have now been reworked to be based on the set tag in your nfo files (if you use nfo). The popular AutoBoxSets plugin is now a built-in feature:\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHDR Tone Mapping When Transcoding\n\n\n\n\tCheck out the new options in the server transcoding menu!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf you have a server machine powerful enough, you can now enjoy tone mapping when transcoding. No more washed out colors !\n\n\n\n\tCombined Next Up and Continue Watching\n\n\n\n\tHopefully this is not a controversial one, but our out of box behavior is now a Netflix-style Continue Watching list, with everything together:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf you prefer the old Next Up section, you can use your Emby user home screen settings to add it back as a configuration section.\n\n\n\n\tNew Live TV Channel Management Screen\n\n\n\n\tThis is a new WMC-inspired channel management screen that will allow you to quickly disable channels you don't want, drag and drop re-order, edit channel names, channel numbers, and map channels to guide data.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tJust click on a channel to edit the options:\n\t\n\n\n\n\tSupport for Live TV Channel Groups (via Tags)\n\n\n\n\tUse the above editor to add tags to channels, and now you'll see a new Tags tab in your Live TV section.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAutomatic importing of groups in m3u tuners is also supported.\n\n\n\n\tYou can even group your channel display into Tags if desired:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tImproved Performance of Live TV Guide Refresh\n\n\n\n\tThe live tv guide refresh process for all live tv should be slightly improved (5-10% faster). But if you're using xmltv guide data, you can expect major, dramatic improvements in the neighborhood of about 70% faster. To give you an example of the improvement, on a guide with 4000 channels, the guide data refresh has gone from roughly 2.5 hours to 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n\tMultiple Channel Logo Support\n\n\n\n\tUsing Emby Guide Data, the server now downloads multiple logos per channel in different colors. This way our apps can choose the most appropriate logo based on your chosen color scheme in the user interface.\n\n\n\n\tIf you don't use Emby Guide Data, you can still configure these logos manually using the image editor.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMulti-Select List Items\n\n\n\n\tLists now have the same multi-select management features that you've already grown accustomed to in poster views.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tMulti-Select Filtering\n\n\n\n\tWhen you filter by genres, tags, studios and other criteria, you can now select multiple.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew User Profile Options to Control Remembering Track Selections\n\n\n\n\tFor both audio and subtitles, you can now control whether or not track selections are remembered, as well as clear your remembered tracks anytime you wish.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew Field Display Options\n\n\n\n\tThe 3-dot menu above lists has been enhanced to allow new fields to be displayed:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis allows you to see ratings in lists if desired.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew and Improved Image Editor\n\n\n\n\tIt comes with the following improvements:\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDedicated options to set an image from a url\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAll image slots visible in the editor to allow you to easily see what can be customized\n\t\n\t\n\t\tEasy drag and drop backdrop reordering\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tNew Live Button in Live TV Guide\n\n\n\n\tAs you scroll ahead in time, now you can easily jump back to the live time with the press of a button.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tLive TV Programs Grouped in Suggestions and Search\n\n\n\n\tYou'll now see Shows and Movies grouped as one single entry, rather than separate entries for every single airing.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tWhen you click on a show, you'll then see all of the showing for it:\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis will make it easier to find shows and movies that you'd like to watch and record.\n\n\n\n\tImproved Single Channel Screen Display\n\n\n\n\tThe single channel listings not only perform better, but now also display much more information than before.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tRemove from Continue Watching\n\n\n\n\tWould you like to get something out of continue watching, but without having to lose your watch progress? Now you can:\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThis will remove it from the Continue Watching menu, and it will reappear if you start watching again.\n\n\n\n\tContext Menu Improvements\n\n\n\n\tThe addition of the title and poster should help make the menus a little more fun to use.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tImproved DLNA Support\n\n\n\n\tDLNA fans will appreciate the following enhancements:\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tImproved device discovery\n\t\n\t\n\t\tImproved ability for other devices to discover your Emby Server\n\t\n\t\n\t\tGreater compatibility with more devices\n\t\n\t\n\t\tMore efficient communications, less chatter on your network between Emby Server and your devices\n\t\n\t\n\t\tAuto-detection of supported audio and photo formats.
